#Installation script to either be installed on client system or on
# other system to then be sent the binary

# Decide if system install or binary compilation only through --system-install
# or --system-compile flags respectably

# Note that --system-compile will assume that the user has more experience
# and knowledge. If you are not experienced or have limited experience with
# the system you are running the client/s on and/or with the
# system itself(linux, mac, windows etc) please consider only --system-install
